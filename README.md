### Chess Backend

Work-in-progress API that makes it possible to play chess games online. Written in NestJs.
This project is a part of my B.Sc. thesis -> Internet application for online chess.

## How to run this API in development?

This app uses Node.js version 14.15.1, MongoDB version 5.0 and Redis 6.2 with Redisearch module installed.

1. Create .env file based on the .env-example template.
2. Install all required packages.
3. Run Redis and MongoDB - either as a services or via Docker.

That's it for now! For a list of available commands see package.json.
